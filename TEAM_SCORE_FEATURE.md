This feature provides data-driven insights for team management, helping organizations better understand team structure, identify potential issues, and develop improvement strategies. 




# Mock GPT Testing Guide

## Overview

This testing system allows you to test real GPT API team compatibility analysis functionality using mock team member data, without worrying about authentication issues.

## üîß Setup Requirements

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration

Ensure your `.env.local` file contains a valid OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. Dependency Check

Ensure the project has the required dependencies installed:
```bash
npm install openai dotenv
```

## üß™ Test Cases

### Mock Team Member Data

The system uses the following 4 virtual team members:

| Member | Email | Role | Main Skills |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| Alice | alice@test.com | Frontend Development Expert | React, TypeScript, UI/UX Design |
| Bob | bob@test.com | Backend Architect | Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS |
| Charlie | charlie@test.com | Project Manager | Project Management, Scrum, Business Analysis |
| David | david@test.com | Test Engineer | Testing, Quality Assurance, Automation |

### Survey Response Examples

Mock survey responses for each member:

**Alice's Responses:**
- Q1: React,TypeScript,UI/UX Design,CSS,JavaScript
- Q2: Web Development,Frontend Development,Mobile Development
- Q3: Senior Frontend Developer,UI/UX Designer,Product Manager

**Bob's Responses:**
- Q1: Node.js,PostgreSQL,Docker,AWS,System Architecture
- Q2: Backend Development,Cloud Computing,DevOps
- Q3: Backend Architect,DevOps Engineer,Technical Lead

## üöÄ Usage Methods

### Method 1: Simple Direct Test

1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Visit the simple test page:
```
http://localhost:3000/simple-test
```

3. Click the "Start Team Analysis" button
4. Wait for GPT API analysis completion (usually takes 5-10 seconds)

### Method 2: Complete Test Flow

1. Visit the complete test page:
```
http://localhost:3000/test-group-score
```

2. Click "Create Mock Test Data"
3. View the generated organization and member information
4. Click "Start Team Analysis"
5. Observe GPT analysis results

## üìä Analysis Results

GPT API will return analysis containing the following content:

### Overall Analysis
- **Overall Compatibility Score** (0-100)
- **Team Strengths** list
- **Potential Gaps** identification
- **Collaboration Potential** assessment
- **Improvement Recommendations** list

### Individual Analysis
Detailed analysis for each member includes:
- **Core Strengths** list
- **Technical Skills** tags
- **Areas of Interest** tags
- **Compatibility Score** (0-100)
- **Role Suggestions**

### Visualization Charts
- **Pie Chart**: Overall compatibility display
- **Bar Chart**: Member compatibility comparison
- **Skills Distribution Chart**: Team skill coverage

## üîç Test Verification Points

### 1. API Call Success
- Confirm seeing the success message "Team analysis completed! (Using mock data)"
- Analysis results are not pre-set hardcoded data

### 2. Data Quality Check
- Analysis results should reflect the skill combinations in mock data
- Scores should be reasonable (expected 80-90 points due to good team complementarity)
- Role suggestions should match members' skill backgrounds

### 3. Error Handling
- If API call fails, backup mock analysis results will be displayed
- Error messages will clearly indicate the reason for failure

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"GPT Analysis Failed" Error**
   - Check if OPENAI_API_KEY is correctly set
   - Confirm API key has valid quota
   - Check network connection

2. **Long Loading Times**
   - GPT API calls usually take 5-15 seconds
   - If over 30 seconds, may be network or API issues

3. **Empty Analysis Results**
   - Check console for error messages
   - Confirm mock data is loaded correctly

### Debugging Tips

1. Open browser developer tools Console tab
2. Check if network requests are successful
3. Check for JavaScript errors

## üìù Expected Output Example

A successful GPT analysis might return results similar to the following:

```json
{
  "overall_score": 87,
  "member_analyses": [
    {
      "member_email": "alice@test.com",
      "strengths": ["Frontend Excellence", "UI/UX Design", "Modern Framework Expertise"],
      "skills": ["React", "TypeScript", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Figma"],
