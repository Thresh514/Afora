# Official Github for Afora
###Visit [Afora!](https://afora.vercel.app/).

## Our goal is to create an all-in-one project management application that goes from team creation all the way to product creation!
#### We primarily target hackathons & education where we know we can do the most social good. You can create "organizations" that host groups. These groups will be generated by our AI model that is based off of user response. We know that hackathons & classrooms run into many logistical issues when trying to do groups, so we do all the work for you. 

### Stack: NextJS (React), Clerk (Authentication), Firebase & React-Firebase-Hooks (Real Time Listener), Shadcn (ui library, Tailwind & TS)
### Deployed on Vercel

### If you are going to work on this project, clone it, then in the terminal after you are in the directory use

```bash
npm install
```

We are currently using Next 14, so it has pages as the framework, making it easier to work with. 

Message Jack or Xavier if you need the keys for firebase, Clerk, and whatever else if you work on this project. 

Wish us luck!
