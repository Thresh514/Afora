# [Afora](https://afora.vercel.app/)

All-in-one project management application that goes from team creation to product creation.

We primarily target hackathons & education where we know we can do the most social good. You can create "organizations" that host groups. These groups will be generated by our AI model that is based off of user response. We know that hackathons & classrooms run into many logistical issues when trying to do groups, so we do all the work for you.

## Stack

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xavieryn/Afora.git
cd Afora
npm install
```

You'll need to setup the Firestore `service_key.json`. It should look something like this:

### service_key.json

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  ...
  "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}
```

Then add the other environment variables. Setup [Clerk](https://dashboard.clerk.com/apps), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/api/)

### .env.local

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
PEXELS_API_KEY=...
```

To startup a local env, just run this:

```bash
npm run dev
```
